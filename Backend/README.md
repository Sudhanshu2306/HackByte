# Backend Documentation

## Overview
The backend of this project is designed to handle the server-side logic for the HackByte application. It provides APIs for managing data, authenticating users, and facilitating communication between the frontend and the database.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Handles user login, registration, and session management.
- **Database Operations**: Manages CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for various entities.
- **API Endpoints**: Provides RESTful APIs for the frontend to interact with the backend.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling to ensure smooth operation.
- **Security**: Includes measures like input validation, token-based authentication, and secure data storage.

## Folder Structure
- **/routes**: Contains route definitions for different API endpoints.
- **/controllers**: Implements the logic for handling requests and responses.
- **/models**: Defines the database schema and interacts with the database.
- **/middlewares**: Includes middleware functions for authentication, validation, etc.
- **/config**: Stores configuration files, such as database connection settings.
- **/utils**: Contains utility functions used across the backend.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js**: Framework for building web applications and APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure user authentication.

## API Endpoints
### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register`: Registers a new user.
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Logs in an existing user.
- `POST /api/auth/logout`: Logs out the user.

### User Management
- `GET /api/users`: Retrieves a list of all users.
- `GET /api/users/:id`: Retrieves details of a specific user.
- `PUT /api/users/:id`: Updates user information.
- `DELETE /api/users/:id`: Deletes a user.

### Additional Features
- Add any additional endpoints or features specific to your project here.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file (e.g., database URI, JWT secret).
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. The server will run on `http://localhost:<PORT>` (default port is 3000).
